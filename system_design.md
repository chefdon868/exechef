# Automated COGs Analysis System Design

## System Overview
Based on the analysis of the provided Excel files and the user's requirements, I'm designing an automated system to streamline the daily Cost of Goods (COGs) analysis process. The system will automatically adjust COGs as revenue budgets rise or fall, eliminating the current manual process.

## Current Workflow Challenges
1. Manual data entry and calculations between multiple Excel files
2. No automated connection between revenue data and procurement/transfer reports
3. Time-consuming daily updates
4. Difficulty in adjusting COGs when revenue budgets change

## Proposed Solution Architecture

### 1. Data Integration Layer
- **Revenue Data Import**: Automated import of daily revenue reports from accounting software
- **Procurement Data Import**: Automated import of transfer reports from procurement team
- **Data Standardization**: Normalize outlet names and categories across all data sources

### 2. COGs Calculation Engine
- **Predefined Targets**: Implement the existing food cost percentage targets (24-25% depending on outlet)
- **Daily Calculations**: Automatically calculate daily COGs based on:
  - Daily revenue by outlet
  - Procurement transfers
  - Target percentages
- **Variance Analysis**: Calculate and highlight variances from targets

### 3. Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism
- **Revenue-COGs Relationship**: Implement formulas that automatically adjust COGs allowances when revenue changes
- **Scaling Factors**: Create scaling factors for different revenue levels
- **Alert System**: Generate alerts when COGs percentages exceed thresholds

### 4. Reporting Dashboard
- **Daily Summary**: Daily COGs vs. target by outlet
- **Trend Analysis**: Rolling averages and trends over time
- **Forecast View**: Projected COGs based on revenue forecasts
- **Exception Reporting**: Highlight outlets exceeding target percentages

## Technical Implementation Options

### Selected Approach: Google Sheets Solution
- **Pros**: 
  - Familiar interface, minimal learning curve, works with existing files
  - Cloud-based with real-time collaboration
  - Accessible from anywhere
  - Free to use
  - Automation capabilities through Google Apps Script
- **Implementation**:
  - Google Sheets formulas for calculations
  - Google Apps Script for automation and data integration
  - Connected sheets for data modeling
  - IMPORTRANGE and query functions for data relationships

## Recommended Approach
Based on user preference for Google Sheets, I recommend a **comprehensive Google Sheets solution**:

1. **Primary Solution**: Enhanced Google Sheets system with Apps Script automation
   - Continues using the user's preferred platform
   - Familiar interface for users
   - Powerful enough for the required calculations
   - Can be automated with Google Apps Script
   - Enables real-time collaboration

2. **Future Expansion**: Additional automation through Google Apps Script
   - Email notifications for exceptions
   - Automated data import from accounting software
   - Mobile-friendly dashboard views

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Create standardized Google Sheets templates for revenue and procurement data
2. Set up IMPORTRANGE and QUERY functions to automatically import and transform data
3. Build a data model connecting revenue and procurement data using sheet references
4. Implement COGs calculation formulas with dynamic adjustment capabilities
5. Create daily reporting views and dashboards with conditional formatting
6. Set up Google Apps Script automation for daily updates and notifications
7. Develop documentation and training materials

## Data Flow Diagram
```
Revenue Reports → Data Import Layer → 
                                      → Data Model → COGs Calculation Engine → 
Procurement Reports → Data Import Layer →                                      → Reporting Dashboard
                                                                              
                                         Target Percentages → Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism →
```

## Next Steps
1. Develop a prototype of the enhanced Excel solution
2. Test with sample data from the provided Excel files
3. Refine the solution based on feedback
4. Create documentation for daily operation
