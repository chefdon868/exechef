# COGs Analysis System Development

## Analysis Phase
- [x] Gather additional information from user
- [x] Analyze current workflow based on provided Excel files
- [x] Design automated COGs system
- [x] Implement Google Sheets integration solution
- [x] Create dynamic adjustment mechanism
- [x] Develop reporting dashboard
- [x] Test system with sample data
- [x] Finalize and document solution

## Current Findings
- Flash Report contains revenue data across three sheets (FGH, PIR 2, PIR)
- Tracking Tool contains separate sheets for each outlet (COPRA, BARAVI, BLACK CORAL, etc.)
- Each outlet has predetermined food cost percentage targets (24-25%)
- Current process is manual, connecting revenue data with procurement data
- Food cost as percentage of sales is the main KPI
- User prefers Google Sheets as the platform for the solution
