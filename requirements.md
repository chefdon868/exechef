  - Localized date and number formats

## Technology Stack Considerations

### 1. Frontend Options
- **Framework**
  - React.js: Component-based UI with efficient rendering
  - Vue.js: Progressive framework with gentle learning curve
  - Angular: Comprehensive framework with strong typing

- **UI Components**
  - Material-UI or Bootstrap for consistent design
  - Chart.js or D3.js for data visualization
  - React Table or similar for data grid functionality

### 2. Backend Options
- **Framework**
  - Node.js with Express: JavaScript-based, efficient for API development
  - Django: Python-based, comprehensive with built-in admin
  - Ruby on Rails: Rapid development with convention over configuration

- **API Architecture**
  - RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
  - GraphQL for flexible data querying (if needed)
  - WebSockets for real-time updates (if needed)

### 3. Database Options
- **SQL Databases**
  - PostgreSQL: Robust, feature-rich open-source database
  - MySQL: Widely used, good performance for read-heavy applications

- **NoSQL Options** (if needed for specific requirements)
  - MongoDB: Flexible schema for evolving data models
  - Firebase: Real-time database with built-in authentication

### 4. Deployment Options
- **Hosting Platforms**
  - Vercel: Optimized for React/Next.js applications
